          A curated collage of pictures that represent community in
          Kitchener-Waterloo and Huron Heights. <br /><br />Hover over each
          image to read what emotions the author sees in their contribution. We
          have tried to represent each image without using the word community so
          that the readers can imagine themselves apart the scene. <br /><br />
          Each picture with its description is just one brick in the beautifully
          crafted community of Kitchener-Waterloo. The site is called Masonry
          for that reason in the way each tile is weaved together like a brick
          wall.
